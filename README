This folder contains the dfnWorks input file and dfnWorks output and ECPM output of 10 different realizations for the initial crystalline reference case. 
Each folder contains a different realization and bulk statistical properties are provided in the folder: bulk_properties. 
The ECPM output is provided with and without user defined fractures and the DFN output includes user defined fractures.

Below is a description of the files in the folder:

ref_case.dat - dfnGen input file (points to user3_mod_input.dat)
user3_mod_input.dat - specifies size, shape, and location of the user defined fractures
create_dfn.py - python script which calls dfnWorks to generate the DFN and then post-processes the transmissivity to match fracture family values in the task specification
mapdfn2pflotran.py - python script to create the ECPM from DFN output. In the file, tortuosity is used as a correction 
factor to get the same effective diffusion coefficient everywhere and upscaled porosity is fracture porosity

In each realization folder:

aperture.dat - fracture apertures (dfnGen output)
perm.dat - fracture permeabilities (dfnGen output)
radii_Final.dat - fracture radii (dfnGen output)
normal_vectors.dat - fracture orientation: unit vector normal to the fracture plane (dfnGen output)
translations.dat - (x,y,z) coordinates of fracture centers (dfnGen output)
polygons.dat - (x,y,z) coordinates of fracture verticies (for teams who need this as input)

anistropic_k.h5 - upscaled anistropic permeabilities (mapdfn2pflotran.py output)
isotropic_k.h5 - upscaled isotropic permeabilities  (mapdfn2pflotran.py output)
materials.h5 - 1 denotes fracture cell, 0 denotes matrix (mapdfn2pflotran.py output)
porosity.h5 - upscaled porosity/fracture porosity (mapdfn2pflotran.py output)
tortuosity.h5 - upscaled tortuosity, used as a correction factor to get same effective diffusion coefficient everywhere (mapdfn2pflotran.py output)

In the bulk_properties folder:
domain_average_mean_and_std-100.csv - Bulk properties for 100 different realizations
domain_average_mean_and_std-10.csv - Bulk properties for the 10 realizations provided
